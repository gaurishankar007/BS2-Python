Big O => Upper-bound (Worst Case), 
Big Omega => Lower bound (Best Case), and 
Big Theta => Mix of the two


Linear Search => Worst Case = O(n) and Best Case = O(1)
Binary Search => Worst Case = O(logn) and Best Case = O(1)
Bubble Sort => Worst Case = O(n^2) and best Case = O(n)
Selection Sort => Worst Case = O(n^2) and best Case = O(n^2)
Insertion Sort => Worst Case = O(n^2) and best Case = O(n)
Merge Sort => Worst Case = O(n*logn) and best Case = O(n*logn)
